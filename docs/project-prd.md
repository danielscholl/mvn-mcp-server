# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Maven MCP Server

## Intro

The Maven MCP Server provides AI-powered dependency management tooling through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling natural language interaction with Maven Central repository. The server implements comprehensive tools for version checking, security scanning, and dependency analysis, optimized for AI workflows and designed to enhance developer productivity in Java ecosystem management.

This is a **multi-phase product** with each phase building upon previous capabilities to deliver a complete Maven dependency management solution. The current document defines the complete product vision while individual specifications detail specific implementation phases.

## Goals and Context

### Project Objectives
* Provide AI-optimized access to Maven Central repository operations
* Enable natural language queries for dependency version management
* Integrate security vulnerability scanning into dependency workflows
* Support batch operations for efficient multi-dependency processing
* Deliver comprehensive version information in single API calls
* Create extensible architecture for future Maven ecosystem features

### Key Success Criteria
* All tools provide complete information in single calls (no multi-step workflows)
* Response times under 2 seconds for single dependency checks
* Batch operations scale linearly with dependency count
* Cache hit rates exceed 80% for common dependencies
* Security scanning identifies known vulnerabilities accurately
* Error messages provide actionable guidance for resolution

## Product Architecture Strategy

### Core Design Philosophy
**AI-First, Developer-Focused**: Create tools that transform natural language requests into precise Maven operations while maintaining the accuracy and reliability required for production Java development.

### Implementation Approach
```
Natural Language Request → MCP Tool → Maven Central API → AI-Optimized Response
```

1. **Comprehensive Information**: Single-call tools that provide complete context
2. **Batch Optimization**: Efficient processing of multiple dependencies
3. **Intelligent Caching**: Reduce API calls through smart caching strategies
4. **Structured Responses**: Consistent formats optimized for LLM consumption

## Multi-Specification Strategy

### Specification Management

Each implementation phase produces detailed specifications that build upon previous work:

1. **Spec Creation**: Triggered when feature requirements are finalized
2. **Spec Validation**: Comprehensive testing before proceeding to next phase
3. **Spec Evolution**: Updates based on real-world usage and feedback
4. **Dependencies**: Later phases leverage validated earlier implementations

## Tool Implementation Patterns

### Standard Tool Pattern
Each tool follows consistent implementation patterns for reliability and maintainability:

```python
@server.tool()
def maven_tool(
    dependency: str = Field(..., description="Maven coordinates (groupId:artifactId)"),
    version: str = Field(..., description="Version to check"),
    **kwargs
) -> ToolResponse:
    """Tool description optimized for AI understanding."""
    
    try:
        # Validate inputs
        validate_maven_coordinate(dependency)
        
        # Check cache first
        cache_key = f"{dependency}:{version}"
        if cached := cache_service.get(cache_key):
            return cached
        
        # Make API call
        result = maven_api_service.check_version(dependency, version)
        
        # Process and cache
        processed = process_for_ai(result)
        cache_service.set(cache_key, processed)
        
        return create_tool_response(
            tool_name="maven_tool",
            status="success",
            result=processed
        )
        
    except MavenAPIError as e:
        return create_error_response(
            tool_name="maven_tool",
            error_code=e.code,
            message=e.message
        )
```

### Batch Processing Pattern
```python
async def process_batch(items: List[DependencyCheck]) -> BatchResult:
    """Process multiple items efficiently."""
    
    # Group by cacheable vs non-cacheable
    cached_results = []
    to_fetch = []
    
    for item in items:
        if cached := cache_service.get(item.cache_key):
            cached_results.append(cached)
        else:
            to_fetch.append(item)
    
    # Fetch non-cached items concurrently
    fetched_results = await asyncio.gather(
        *[fetch_item(item) for item in to_fetch],
        return_exceptions=True
    )
    
    # Combine and return
    return BatchResult(
        cached=len(cached_results),
        fetched=len(fetched_results),
        results=cached_results + fetched_results
    )
```
