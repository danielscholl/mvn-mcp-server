# ADR-012: Maven Profile-Based Security Scanning

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-01-27

## Context

Maven projects frequently use profiles to manage environment-specific configurations, particularly in multi-cloud deployments. For example, the OSDU partition service uses separate profiles for AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, and Google Cloud deployments, each with provider-specific dependencies.

**Challenges with profile-agnostic scanning:**
1. Cannot isolate vulnerabilities by deployment target
2. Scans all dependencies regardless of which would actually be deployed
3. Cannot answer "What vulnerabilities affect my Azure deployment specifically?"
4. No way to compare security posture across deployment profiles
5. Mixed results make remediation planning unclear

**The fundamental problem:** Trivy is a filesystem scanner that doesn't understand Maven's build system, profiles, or dependency resolution. It scans what's physically present, not what Maven would actually build and deploy.

## Decision

Implement profile-based security scanning using Maven's `help:effective-pom` plugin to generate resolved POMs for each profile, then scan those effective POMs with Trivy.

### Core Strategy
1. **When profiles specified AND Maven available**: Generate effective POM per profile
2. **Scan each effective POM** independently with Trivy
3. **Aggregate results** with per-profile breakdown and cross-profile analysis
4. **Graceful fallback** to workspace scanning when Maven unavailable

### Implementation Approach
**Effective POM Generation:**
```bash
mvn help:effective-pom -P<profile> -Doutput=<temp-file>
```

This resolves:
- Parent POM inheritance
- Property variable substitution
- BOM (Bill of Materials) imports
- Profile-specific dependencies
- Dependency management overrides

**Scanning Flow:**
```
scan_java_project(workspace, include_profiles=["azure", "aws"])
  ‚Üí Check Maven availability
  ‚Üí Generate effective-pom-azure.xml
  ‚Üí Generate effective-pom-aws.xml
  ‚Üí Scan effective-pom-azure.xml with Trivy
  ‚Üí Scan effective-pom-aws.xml with Trivy
  ‚Üí Aggregate results with cross-profile analysis
  ‚Üí Return per-profile breakdown + common vulnerabilities
  ‚Üí Cleanup temporary effective POMs
```

## Rationale

### Why Maven Effective POM Approach

**Accuracy**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
- Uses Maven's own dependency resolution engine
- Guarantees 100% accuracy with Maven's build behavior
- Handles all Maven features (inheritance, BOMs, properties, profiles)

**Industry Standard**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
- `help:effective-pom` is the canonical way to see resolved dependencies
- Used by developers for debugging Maven builds
- Well-documented and stable Maven plugin

**Completeness**: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
- Handles complex multi-module projects
- Resolves transitive dependencies
- Respects dependency exclusions
- Processes property interpolation

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Option 1: Pure Python POM Parsing**
- **Rejected**: Would require reimplementing Maven's resolution logic
- **Complexity**: Too high, prone to edge cases and inconsistencies
- **Maintenance**: High burden to keep up with Maven features

**Option 2: Module-Based Directory Scanning**
- **Rejected**: Doesn't handle profile-specific dependencies within modules
- **Incomplete**: Misses profile's effect on dependency resolution
- **Inefficient**: Multiple Trivy scans of same directories

## Implementation Details

### New Components

**Service Layer:**
- `MavenEffectivePomService`: Encapsulates Maven interaction
  - `check_maven_availability()`: Detect Maven presence
  - `generate_effective_pom()`: Create effective POM for profiles
  - `generate_effective_poms_for_profiles()`: Batch generation
  - `cleanup_effective_poms()`: Temporary file management

**Tool Enhancements:**
- `_scan_with_profiles()`: Orchestrates profile-based scanning
- `_aggregate_profile_results()`: Combines multi-profile results
- `_analyze_profile_specificity()`: Identifies common vs. unique CVEs

**Data Models:**
- `ProfileScanResult`: Individual profile scan results
- `ProfileSpecificAnalysis`: Cross-profile vulnerability comparison
- Enhanced `JavaSecurityScanResult` with profile fields

### Error Codes
- `MAVEN_NOT_AVAILABLE`: Maven not found on system
- `MAVEN_EXECUTION_ERROR`: Maven command failed
- `EFFECTIVE_POM_GENERATION_ERROR`: POM generation issues
- `PROFILE_NOT_FOUND`: Specified profile doesn't exist

## Consequences

### Positive

**‚úÖ Deployment-Specific Analysis**
- Isolate Azure vulnerabilities from AWS vulnerabilities
- Answer "What does my GCP deployment need to fix?"
- Compare security posture across cloud providers

**‚úÖ Accurate Dependency Resolution**
- Uses Maven's exact resolution logic
- Handles complex inheritance and BOM imports
- Respects profile-specific property overrides

**‚úÖ Enterprise Multi-Cloud Support**
- Perfect for OSDU, Spring Cloud, and similar multi-profile projects
- Enables targeted remediation without cross-contamination
- Supports dev/test/prod profile scanning

**‚úÖ Graceful Degradation**
- Falls back to workspace scanning when Maven unavailable
- Clear messaging about scan limitations
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

**‚úÖ Cross-Profile Intelligence**
- Identifies vulnerabilities common to all profiles
- Highlights profile-specific security issues
- Enables smart remediation strategies

### Negative

**‚ö†Ô∏è Maven Dependency**
- Requires Maven installation for profile scanning
- Adds ~60s overhead for effective POM generation per profile
- Falls back to workspace scan if Maven unavailable

**‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary File Management**
- Creates temporary effective POM files (~700KB each)
- Requires cleanup logic (implemented with try/finally)
- Disk I/O overhead

**‚ö†Ô∏è Effective POM Scanning Limitation**
- Effective POMs are XML definitions, not resolved JARs
- Trivy scans POM files, not the actual dependency artifacts
- May need additional scanning strategy for full coverage

### Neutral

**üìù Testing Complexity**
- Requires mocking Maven commands
- Integration tests need Maven and real repositories
- Test suite runtime increases (~2 minutes for integration tests)

**üìù Documentation Requirements**
- Users need to understand profile concept
- Clear examples required for multi-cloud scenarios
- Error messages must guide Maven installation

‚úÖ Scans Azure-specific dependencies
‚úÖ Completes in ~30 seconds

# Multi-cloud comparison
scan_java_project_tool(workspace="repos/partition", include_profiles=["aws", "azure", "ibm", "gc"])
‚úÖ Generates 4 effective POMs
‚úÖ Scans each provider independently
‚úÖ Provides cross-profile analysis
‚úÖ Completes in ~2 minutes
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Maven availability check**: <1 second
- **Effective POM generation**: ~15-30 seconds per profile
- **Trivy scan per profile**: ~10-15 seconds
- **Total for 4 profiles**: ~2 minutes
- **File sizes**: ~600-700KB per effective POM

**Performance is acceptable** for security scanning workflows where accuracy is paramount.
