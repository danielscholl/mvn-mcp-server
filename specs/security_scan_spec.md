# MCP Server Tool Spec - Java Security Scan

> A Java-specific tool for scanning Maven projects for vulnerabilities and providing detailed information about detected security issues.

## Scope

This tool is **exclusively for Java/Maven projects**. 
The tool focuses solely on vulnerability **detection and reporting**.

## Required Implementation Tasks

- [x] ‚úÖ Implement Java-specific project scanning using Trivy for vulnerability detection focusing on pom.xml files
- [x] ‚úÖ Support Maven multi-module projects with parent-child relationships and nested directory structures
- [x] ‚úÖ Enable scanning Maven profiles and conditional dependencies
- [x] ‚úÖ Handle BOMs (Bill of Materials) and dependency management sections
- [x] ‚úÖ Process version properties and version inheritance
- [x] ‚úÖ Build comprehensive vulnerability report with severity levels and remediation recommendations
- [x] ‚úÖ Implement proper error handling for scanning operations
- [x] ‚úÖ Implement Trivy availability detection and provide clear error messages when unavailable
- [x] ‚úÖ Make sure this functionality works end to end as an MCP tool in the server.py file

## Trivy Integration

This tool uses [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) for vulnerability scanning. Trivy is an external dependency that must be installed on the system where the MCP server runs.

### Trivy Configuration

1. **Availability Check**
   - On server initialization, check if Trivy is available by running `trivy --version`
   - If Trivy is not available, provide a clear error message instructing the user to install Trivy
   - No configuration parameters are needed - Trivy is expected to be available in the PATH

2. **Direct Scanning Approach**
   - Use Trivy to scan the entire project directory directly
   - Parse pom.xml files to understand the Maven structure
   - Use Trivy's filesystem scanning capabilities with the `--security-checks vuln` flag
   - Format results as JSON for easy parsing
   - Extract relevant vulnerability information from the scan results

### Tool Details
- Implemented in `src/mvn_mcp_server/tools/java_security_scan.py`
- **scan_java_project()**
  - Validate the Java project directory path (confirms presence of pom.xml)
  - Check Trivy availability
  - Execute Trivy scan on the project directory
  - Parse and format vulnerability scan results
  - Group vulnerabilities by severity
  - Provide detailed information including vulnerability IDs, descriptions, and suggested remediation versions
  - Return comprehensive vulnerability report
- Performance optimizations:
  - Use temporary files for efficient processing of Trivy results
  - Clean error handling for various failure scenarios

### Input Rules
- For scan_java_project_tool:
  - `workspace` is required and must be a valid Java project directory path with pom.xml
  - `include_profiles` is optional string array of profile IDs to activate during scan
  - `scan_all_modules` is optional boolean (default true) to scan all modules or just the specified project

### Testing Requirements
- Run tests with `uv run pytest`
- Tests should:
  - Mock Trivy commands and responses for predictable testing
  - Test error handling for when Trivy is not available
  - Verify correct parsing of Trivy results
- Test coverage requirements:
  - Successful scanning with vulnerabilities detected
  - Clear error when Trivy is not available
  - Error handling for invalid workspaces
  - Error handling for non-Maven projects
- Tests must verify correctness across normal and boundary cases

## Tool to Expose

```text
scan_java_project_tool(
    workspace: str,
    include_profiles: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    scan_all_modules: bool = True
) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### Response Format
